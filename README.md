# AVS Registration

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum RPC endpoint to send transactions.


## Step 1: Request ether.fi team to be registered as a Delegated AVS operator

You will be assigned an operatorID and an operator smart contract that is registered with eigenlayer
- `operatorId`: AVS operator ID assigned by ether.fi team.
- `operatorAddress`: Eigenlayer operator address, which is managed by ether.fi team.

## Step 2: Follow the instructions for the specific AVS you are registering for

2. Sign required inputs for registering watchtower

        // Expose the private key generated above as an environment variable "WATCHTOWER_PRIVATE_KEY"

Generate a separate ECDSA key you control for the value of `operator_private_key`, and request the witnesschain team to whitelist this address on their L2.
Be sure to explicitly set `"eth_rpc_url": ""` (set it to empty value) in your config file so that the cli only registers the watchtower on the L2

# Adding a new AVS to the CLI

### 1. Understand the complete registration flow for the AVS you are adding
Ether.fi utilizes a contract based operator alongside EIP-1271 signing. Most AVS's do not support this
out of the box. Please confirm that their contracts will be compatible with this scheme.
Many AVS's also utilize different styles of keys/signatures and different numbers of them and even multiple chains.
Figure out which actions need to be taken by the individual node operators and which need to be 
done by an ether.fi admin with the EIP-1271 signing key.
Please take the time to open a PR against https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/avs-smart-contracts/
with a test walking through the entire registration flow. You can find an examples in the `test/` directory of the avs-smart-contracts repo

### 2. Add a new command for your avs to `bin/avs-cli/main.go`
Add your top level command to this file and then implement subcommands in their own package.
For an example see https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/etherfi-avs-operator-CLI/tree/witness-chain/bin/avs-cli/witness-chain
The CLI command should be a simple wrapper that forwards data to the package you implement
in the following step

### 3. Implement core logic in a new package `src/avs/{my_avs}`
Please also place any abi's and generated bindings in this package.
For an example see https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/etherfi-avs-operator-CLI/blob/witness-chain/src/witnesschain/witnesschain.go

### 4. Update readme with registration instructions
